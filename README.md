#Pastiche Party: Hemispheres

This project was made using 6 art assets assigned to us; No more or less. We were allowed to modify them however we wanted, but they had to be identifiable still.

Summary of Game
---------------

The two halves of the brain, one creative and one logical, decide that they would be better off alone. They soon realize they need each other and in order to come back as one, both sides need to be used. The puzzle forces you to be both logical and creative.
